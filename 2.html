<h1>CSS란 무엇인가?</h1>
<p>
Media Queries is an enhancement of the
<a href ="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html" target="blank" title="css speicificarion">
media rules of CSS</a> and the “media” attribute in HTML.<br>
It adds parameters such as size of display,color depth and aspect ratio.<br>
This is because within a class of media (such as TV sets) there can still be important variations.<br>
It is related to the work on CC/PP, but is a much more light-weight and limited solution.

Media Queries defines a syntax for short expressions that describe required features of media (or devices),<br>
e.g.: minimum or maximum screen size, color capabilities, resolution, aspect ratio, type of pointing device, <br>
viewing environment, scripting capabilities, etc.<br>
